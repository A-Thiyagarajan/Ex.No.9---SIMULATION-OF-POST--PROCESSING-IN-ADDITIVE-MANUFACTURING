## OUTPUT :

## Support Removal Process
### Step 1:

In a 3D printer, the main part refers to the primary structure or framework that holds and guides the printing process, typically including the frame, motors, and control systems.

Support in a 3D printer refers to the additional structures or materials used to provide stability and reinforcement to the printed object during the printing process, such as support structures or rafts that are printed alongside the main part to prevent deformation or collapse.


Together, the main part and support elements in a 3D printer ensure the accuracy, stability, and successful fabrication of complex three-dimensional objects by providing a solid foundation and temporary scaffolding when necessary.

### Step 2:

A container refers to a vessel or reservoir used to store and dispense a chemical solution, such as a resin or filament material, which is essential for the printing process.

A chemical solution in a 3D printer typically refers to a specialized material, such as a photopolymer resin, that undergoes a chemical reaction, such as curing or solidification, when exposed to specific conditions, such as UV light or heat. This solution is used as the raw material for creating 3D printed objects.

The container holds the chemical solution, which is then selectively dispensed and processed by the 3D printer to form successive layers and ultimately build the desired object. The properties and characteristics of the chemical solution greatly impact the final quality and properties of the printed object.

### Step 3:
When a 3D model is dropped into a chemical solution in the context of 3D printing, it typically refers to a process known as resin or vat polymerization. The model is submerged or lowered into a liquid resin or photopolymer solution.

Once the model is immersed in the chemical solution, it undergoes a chemical reaction, often triggered by light exposure or heat, causing the resin to solidify or cure selectively, layer by layer, following the design of the 3D model.

This process allows for the creation of intricate and precise three-dimensional objects with fine details, as the chemical solution hardens and adheres to the model's surfaces, forming a solid, tangible representation of the original 3D model.


### Step 4:

In 3D printing, the main part refers to the primary component or structure of the printed object itself, excluding any support structures or additional elements.

It represents the intended design or shape that is being fabricated layer by layer, using the chosen printing technology and material, without the need for additional temporary or auxiliary structures.

The main part in 3D printing is the final desired outcome, embodying the form and function specified in the 3D model, and does not include any additional support structures that may be required during the printing process.




## UV Curing of 3D printed part
### Step 1:



Before UV curing in the context of 3D printing, the part refers to the printed object that has been created through the additive manufacturing process, typically using a resin-based material.

At this stage, the part is in a semi-solid or liquid state, as it has been formed by depositing and solidifying layers of the printing material, but has not yet undergone the final curing or hardening process.

The part may still be fragile or prone to deformation, and additional post-processing steps, such as cleaning or removal of excess material, may be necessary before subjecting it to UV curing.

### Step 2:
